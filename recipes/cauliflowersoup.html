    <h2>Description </h2>
        <p>This delicious soup is quick and easy to make. You're likely to have all ingredients on hand!
            This soup actually tastes better with a day or two in the fridge, after all the flavors get to know each other.
        </p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1 large head of cauliflower</li>
            <li>4 cups water</li>  
            <li>2 tablespoons butter</li>  
            <li>2 tablespoons flour</li>   
            <li>1 1/2 cups milk</li>    
            <li>salt and pepper</li>
        </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Wash the cauliflower and cut it into florets.</li>
            <li>Boil a pot with the water (add more if necessary to fully cover the cauliflower florets). Salt water lightly.</li>
            <li>Add cauliflower florets and boil for about 15 minutes, until tender.</li>
            <li>In a separate frying pan, melt butter, and add flour. Cook for a couple of minutes until slightly browned - this is a roux.</li>
            <li>Add a bit of the cauliflower water to the roux and mix to incorporate. Continue to add water and incoporate into the pan, until you have a slurry.</li>
            <li>Add slurry back into pot with cauliflower.</li>
            <li>Mash cauliflower using a potato masher.</li>
            <li>Add milk, and bring to a boil.</li>
            <li>Add salt, pepper, and optionally nutmeg to taste.</li>
        </ol>
        <p><strong>Note:</strong> Soup tastes better after a day or two in the fridge.</p>
