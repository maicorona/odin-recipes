    <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>This velvety, buttery tomato sauce requires little effort and with big reward.</p>
        <p>If you live somewhere where you can get fresh, sweet tomatoes - you're in luck, because this recipe is about to change your life.</p>
        <p>Otherwise, fear not, for canned tomatoes will come to your rescue and you, too, can enjoy all the goodness this sauce has to offer.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>2 cups tomatoes, with their juices (either fresh tomatoes or a 28-oz can of San Marzano whole peeled tomatoes)</li>
            <li>5 tbsp butter</li>
            <li>1 onion, peeled and cut in half</li>
            <li>Salt</li>
        </ul>
    <h3>Instructions</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Combine the tomatoes, their juices, the butter and the onion halves in a saucepan. Add a pinch or two of salt.</li>
            <li>Place over medium heat and bring to a simmer. Cook, uncovered, for about 45 minutes. Stir occasionally, mashing any large pieces of tomato with a spoon. Add salt as needed.</li>
            <li>Discard the onion before tossing the sauce with pasta. This recipe makes enough sauce for a pound of pasta.</li>
            <li><em>Optional (but recommended):</em> Top with fresh basil and shredded parmesan.</li>
        </ol>
