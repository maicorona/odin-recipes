    <h2>Description></h2>
        <p>This cake recipe is taken from <a href="https://www.onceuponachef.com/recipes/summer-strawberry-cake.html">Once Upon A Chef</a>, with several notes by me at the bottom after making.</p>
        <p>It's quick, delicious, and easy! You most likely have everything needed in your pantry already, all you need are some fresh strawberries!</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1 & 1/2 cups AP flour</li>
            <li>1 & 1/2 tsp baking powder</li>
            <li>1/2 tsp salt</li>
            <li>6 tbsp unsalted butter, softened</li>
            <li>1 cup plus 2 tbsp sugar, divided</li>
            <li>1 large egg</li>
            <li>1 tsp vanilla extract</li>
            <li>1/2 cup milk</li>
            <li>About 3/4 lbs fresh strawberries, hulle and halved</li>
        </ul>
    <h3>Directions</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 350°F and butter a 9-inch deep dish pie pan or 9-inch square cake pan.</li>
        <li>In a medium bowl, whisk together the flour, baking powder and salt. Set aside.</li>
        <li>In the bowl of an electric mixer, beat the butter and 1 cup of the sugar until pale and fluffy, about 3 minutes. Add the egg and vanilla and beat on low speed until well combined. Gradually add the flour mixture, alternating with the milk, and beat on low speed until smooth. (Note: the batter will be thick.)</li>
        <li>Transfer the batter to the prepared pan and smooth with a spatula (if you use a square cake pan, the batter will only come about 3/4-inch up the sides of the pan -- that's ok). Arrange the strawberries on top, cut side down, so that they completely cover the batter (the recipe calls for approximately 3/4 pound of strawberries; use more or less if necessary). Sprinkle the remaining 2 tablespoons of sugar over the strawberries.</li>
        <li>Bake for ten minutes, then reduce the heat to 325°F and bake until the cake is lightly golden and a tester comes out clean, about an hour. Let the cake cool in the pan on a rack. Serve with sweetened whipped cream or vanilla ice cream, if desired. </li>  
        <li>Cake can be stored at room temperature for several days, loosely covered.</li>
    </ol>
